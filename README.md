# Arities - Function types and Tuples for Java

Since vavr is doing a redesign and removing function types and
tuples, I have found them really useful.

This project is partly part of immutable-json already, and
I have joined code from vavr current and immutable-json-codec here.

## Where to get it?
Current version is: [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.hamnaberg/arities/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/net.hamnaberg/arities)

### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.hamnaberg</groupId>
  <artifactId>arities</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```groovy
compile "net.hamnaberg:arities:VERSION"
```

### SBT
```scala
libraryDependencies += "net.hamnaberg" % "arities" % "VERSION"
```
