# Arities - Function types and Tuples for Java

We currently have arities up to 27.
Why 27 you may ask? There really is no good reason for that, other than that is what Immutable-JSON has support for. 
We can generate as many as we want, it is mainly a matter of you need to stop somewhere.

If there are any users of this library that is not me, If you need me to bump the arity-size,
send a Pull Request.

This library is used by Immutable-JSON Codecs.
